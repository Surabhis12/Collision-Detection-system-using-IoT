As the number of vehicles increases, road accidents are on the rise every day. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey, 1.4 million people have died, and 50 million people have been injured worldwide every year. The key cause of death is the unavailability of response time in the rescue operation. This project deals with the concept which can detect accidents or damage without any human assistance. Detection of accidents is done automatically by using a simple setup that will be embedded in the vehicle. Once the vehicle met with an accident the accident detection setup will sense the buzzer and immediately sends the location to the user contact numbers. An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and sends the live location to all the contacts of the user. This will help us to minimize delays in a rescue operation that could save many lives.


A collision detection system is a safety system designed to warn, alert, or assist drivers to avoid imminent collisions and reduce the risk of accidents.

The system will be IoT based and will have five components i.e Arduino Board, GSM Module 800A, buzzer, accelerometer, GPS location tracker. The main objective of this project is to reduce the time factor in case of accidents. There are many cases where an accident occurs during the night and the person met with the accident is unconscious then it would take hours for someone to find out and inform the authorities about it. So, saving such precious time will indeed save lives. Once the vehicle met with an accident the accident detection setup will sense the buzzer and immediately sends the location to the user contact numbers. An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and sends the live location to all the contacts of the user.
