As the number of vehicles increases, road accidents are on the rise every day. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey, 1.4 million people have died, and 50 million people have been injured worldwide every year. The key cause of death is the unavailability of response time in the rescue operation. This project deals with the concept which can detect accidents or damage without any human assistance. Detection of accidents is done automatically by using a simple setup that will be embedded in the vehicle. Once the vehicle met with an accident the accident detection setup will sense the buzzer and immediately sends the location to the user contact numbers. An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and sends the live location to all the contacts of the user. This will help us to minimize delays in a rescue operation that could save many lives.


A collision detection system is a safety system designed to warn, alert, or assist drivers to avoid imminent collisions and reduce the risk of accidents.

The system will be IoT based and will have five components i.e Arduino Board, GSM Module 800A, buzzer, accelerometer, GPS location tracker. The main objective of this project is to reduce the time factor in case of accidents. There are many cases where an accident occurs during the night and the person met with the accident is unconscious then it would take hours for someone to find out and inform the authorities about it. So, saving such precious time will indeed save lives. Once the vehicle met with an accident the accident detection setup will sense the buzzer and immediately sends the location to the user contact numbers. An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and sends the live location to all the contacts of the user.

	CONCLUSION

The proposed programmed accident detection system can be a rescuer of life for the people 
who met with accidents. The proposed system is exceptionally easy to understand and even a non-specialized Person can use it without any problem. The system consists of equipment and programming segments.  The equipment unit includes accident detection sensors that are constrained by an Arduino board and is fitted in the vehicle. Then again, the programming part is an Android application introduced in drivers Smartphones which is used to get the point by point map. In general, the benefits of this system are low cost, secure and simple to use. The system introduced in this work reduces the casualties due to accidents.
Accident detection operation is not an easy task to handle;
it can be an extremely complicated process when it comes to
real time applications, which is the main reason why it is not
implemented yet on  a  large scale. The proposed  system  will
help to improve the present scenarios.
• Although   in-vehicle   accident   detection   system
provides emergency  responders with essential information as
fast as possible but unavailability of this system are restricted
by   their   non-portability   and   costs,   whereas   Smartphone

•	Although in-vehicle accident detection system provides emergency responders with essential information as fast as possible but unavailability of this system are restricted by their non-portability and costs, whereas Smartphone provides a promising platform with same sensors at cheap price and portability benefits. Smartphone can surpass the functionality of conventional in vehicle accident detection system.
